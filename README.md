# Docker Lab 006
This examples main aim is to getting used to docker-compose

## Docker-Compose

Docker-compose is a savior. When we have to build and run the container that we created, we are struggling with the commands, which is a lot. But this is where the docker-compose comes into play. By creating this docker-compose file, we only use 

    docker-compose up 

and

    docker-compose down


That easy! This way we can build and run our container apps faster compared to using cli. To automate processes, this approach helps us greatly.

Btw while giving us a lot of relief with commands, docker-compose lets us use .env file too. We are able to use environment variables that we dont wanna share accross internet.
